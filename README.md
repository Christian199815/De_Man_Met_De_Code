## Creating your own projects

### Prepr setup
For displaying your own projects in the website you would have to make an account at prepr.
When you have made your account and setup your environment you can create your schema's.
The images below show what the types of input are and what names they should have for the code in the web app to find them.
There are 2 schema's you would have to make, the project is for the horizontal and vertical cards, the square item is for the small filler blocks.

### Add the Api key

Under settings in the backend of prepr you have the Acces Tokens page.
Here you would need to create the tokens which would we need to implement in the code project for all the calls to be able to connect.
In your project create an .env file and add the variables down below, make sure you edit the PREPR_TOKEN & PREPR_API_URL with your own data.

```
PREPR_TOKEN=[your prepr token]
PREPR_API_URL=[your prepr url]

# Server Configuration
PORT=[port you want to use]
```

### Prepr API Explorer

In the prepr backend under where you have found the accestokens is a link to the API Explorer.
After creating the project and square item schema's double check with the API Explorer if you have selected the right names and types!
